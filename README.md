Under Construction/ Python 2.7/ This should not be used as it is against etherscan policy. Only for educational purposes
### 
Tracking Ethereum Whales<br />
### 
This script parses the data found in etherscan(Live Blockchain Explorer) and traces transactions bigger than 20ETH(you can customize this). Then it logs the  
addresses and the exact amounts in a text file.<br />
###
Create the txt in the same directory with the script. Run as ```python whaleLogger.py txtName.txt```<br />

Note: This is the first draft and its poorly written. The final form of this project will be a lot different
